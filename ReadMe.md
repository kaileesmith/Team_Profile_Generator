# Team Profile Generator
For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a Node environment application that allows the user to input employee information that will be displayed on the team's webpage.


## User Story
```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```

## Installation
After you have forked this repo, run "npm install" in your terminal. In order to initate the program, run "node app.js" in your terminal.


## Usage
After the modules are installed, the user can choose to add an employee. You will do this by answering a series of prompts about the employee. Once the prompts are complete, a html file will be generated and include all information inputed.
